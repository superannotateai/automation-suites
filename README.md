# automation-suites

In this repository we will continuously post automation-suites for the annotation process at SuperAnnotate. Notebooks are originally written and tested in Google Colab. So if you are looking for a plug and play Google Colab is the way to go.

We encourage the community to open pull requests and share with us their automation pipeplines in the form of IPython notebooks
